    "Now it's your turn! Here are the questions I would like you to get the data to answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which hours of the day do the most accidents occur during?\n",
    "    * Return a table that has information on how many accidents occurred in each hour of the day in 2015, sorted by the the number of accidents which occurred each hour. Use either the accident_2015 or accident_2016 table for this, and the timestamp_of_crash column. (Yes, there is an hour_of_crash column, but if you use that one you won't get a chance to practice with dates. :P)\n",
    "    * **Hint:** You will probably want to use the [EXTRACT() function](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/functions-and-operators#extract_1) for this.\n",
    "* Which state has the most hit and runs?\n",
    "    * Return a table with the number of vehicles registered in each state that were involved in hit-and-run accidents, sorted by the number of hit and runs. Use either the vehicle_2015 or vehicle_2016 table for this, especially the registration_state_name and hit_and_run columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer these questions, you can fork this notebook by hitting the blue \"Fork Notebook\" at the very top of this page (you may have to scroll up). \"Forking\" something is making a copy of it that you can edit on your own without changing the original."
